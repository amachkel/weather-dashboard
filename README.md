# Weather Dashboard

## How It Works
When the user searches for a city, current and future data for that city is fetched from a third party API and displayed on the screen. They will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index for the current conditions. A five day forecast will display the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. As the user searches for more cities, buttons with their search history will be added. The user can then click these buttons and be taken to the weather data for that city.
